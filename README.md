# Detection and Tracking of Dynamic Ocean Carbon Uptake Regimes Built upon Spatial Target-Driver Relationships via Adaptive Hierarchical Clustering 
## Python Environment
Conda environment: \
`conda create -n carbon_states python=3.8.13` \
`conda activate carbon_states`

Install the dependencies: \
`pip install requirements.txt`

Update the requirements.txt file if you install additional packages: \
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## Pipeline
`jupyter notebook` \
Run the .ipynb file.

## Data
